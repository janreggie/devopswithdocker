# devopswithdocker

Collection of my solutions for the [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/)
online course.
There are three parts in the entire course,
and the repository is modeled as such.

All of my responses for the exercises are in the folders
`partX/X-Y/`, where `X.Y` is the corresponding exercise number.
`build.fish` contains commands used to create images or spin containers.
They also contain the output for commands I ran.

Note that yes, I used the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/).
It's a lot easier for me.
That's all.
